          <strong>Climate movement</strong>
          <br /><br />

          Combat with global climate change has been going on for more than 30 years. Despite numerous conferences, efforts taken by some countries and large companies, serious results are yet to be reached. GHG content in the air increases by 0,5-0,7 % yearly. Total emissions increase by 350-500 million tons  every year   with the population growth. Per capita emissions of 6,6 thousand tons per year do not decrease.Many climate activists and the general public gather the  efforts are futile. But this situation can be changed.
          <br /><br />
          By discarding the false concept of “net zero”,  reducing emissions by about 20 billion tons of CO2e per year, we can stabilize the GHG content in the Earth’s atmosphere and maintain existing climatic conditions, adaptation to which is not difficult. Thus, the problem of global climate change on Earth can be solved
          <br /><br />
          A radical reform of the climate movement is needed

          De-emission - is a key concept of the Initiative. <br>
          De-emission is carried out by any person - natural or legal - in the process of implementing activities that lead to GHG emission reduction, removal , storage , improvement of absorbing capacity of natural complexes. <br>
          De-emission results have to be verified solely by the emitter or by designated professional organizations using specially designed software. De-emission measures implementation is expected to be declarative. Accounting is carried out in Defined tons of de-emission (DTD), where 1 DTD=1 ton CO2e is confirmed by emitter’s assessment and verified by the Initiative’s adopted procedure.

          <br>
          <br>
          Carbon Units and DTD are accounted in The Initiative Carbon Registry. <br>

          As DCRT are backed by real carbon units - tons of CO2e de-emission - they can be canceled (burnt) to offset emitter’s carbon footprint. As DCRT s are “burnt” they are transferred to special purses that can not be accessed and same amount of CUs is  canceled - i.e..get deregistered for good. Millions of CUs in the registry are eligible for emitters who would like to offset carbon footprint - own, of goods they produce or mankind’s. <br>
          The Initiative issues NFT certificates in favor of the emitters, confirming carbon footprint offset in in tCO2e and relative to emitter’s total carbon footprint
